The resulting data sets are produced by the run_analysis.R and as described in the **README.md**.

The result data frame has the following structure:

| column        | description                                              | type    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| subject       | Identifier of the subject                                | integer |
| activity.name | Name of the activity                                     | factor  |
| _featureName_ | Value of a selected feature                              | number  | 

The feature names are close to the original names listed in the features.txt but changed as conform column name.
